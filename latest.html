  <h>Vasco late for Victory</h1>
  <p> The fire was up to full heat tonight in Rio as Vasco and Sevilla played out what was surely the game of the season so far. Vasco were 
   dealt a massive blow as haaland was still absend due to coronavirus illness and 5g chip implantation vaccine surgery so Leao had to step
   up in only his 2nd start of the season. With Balotelli banging them in for Seville in recent games could Leao compete. A tale of two strikers.
   One in red hot form and the other in from the cold. <p>Well it certainly was a night for attack as defenses could not handle the Cococabana Sweltering
  heat tonight. Leao straight out the cold and on fire with a quick goal to set the precedings. But straight away a fanatasitc 20yard strike
  from Ocampaos silecned the home fans as it flew into top corner. But Leao was back at it and preceded to bang in 2 more goals for a quick first half
  hat trick. The Samba was deafining, there was only one team here tonight and looked no way back for Sevilla. 
  
But of course Balotelli was still to have his say in the match and some potent attacking from the away team and poor defense got them back in
  it to get 3-3. Looking like heading to half time a comedy of errors as Pepe Reina failed to collect the ball twice and once it went through his legs left an 
  easy tap in and a crazy turn around as Seville went from down and out to leading at the break.
  
  Could this game get any crazier. A Hamsik goal early into the second period levelled the tie once again. But straight from kick off another
  goal for Sevilla and Vasco having to chase game. Leao the hero with the first half hat trick became villain as he missed two easy chances.
  It looked as if the game was over. But heading to the 90th minute a patient attack and well played through pass sent Leao in to make ammends for recent
  miss and leve the tie. A great escape but nothing less thatn the home team desereved and overall a thrilling end to the game. Or was it?
  
Deep into 3minute of added time and Vasco happy to take the draw the steal the ball and make a quick break. So much space, where Sevilla going for a late
  winner? But it breakt Greizmann who slips on fresh super sub Castillejo who runs free in on goal which will surely be last kick of the game.
  40 yard run to the goalkeeper seemed to take about 5mins and ElPesidentes hands were surely shaking by this point, could he maintain his nerves and 
  get a cruel late winner. Will he chip, will he finesse, will keeper come out, will keeper come out then go back, then come out then go back agagin
  all kind of thoughts running through his head. But he had faith in his man Sami, who made the decision for him with a well placed finesse into bottom corner.
  It was all over. 6-5 to Vasco. And what a game, it had everything. Elpesidente is apparently in ER with heart attack and Shaka_Zulu suicide watch. We hope 
  to bring you good news about their fortunes soon.</p>
