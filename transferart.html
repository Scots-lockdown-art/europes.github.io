	<h2>The biggest transfers:</h2>
    
  <ul>
	  <li>Keita 90m to Boca Jnrs in auction</li>
<li>Fekir 80m from Betis to Inter Milan</li>
<li>Musa 76m to Vasco da Gama in auction</li>   </ul>

	<h2>The biggest transfers between managers:</h2>
    
  <ul>
	  <li>Fekir 80m from Betis to Inter Milan</li>
<li>Ibrahimovic 72m from Southampton to Betis</li>
<li>De Paul 70m from Udinese to Inter Milan</li>
	    </ul>

  <br>
  <p> The busiest clubs in the window were Flamengo, Villareal and Bilibao who all added more than 12 new players to their teamâ€™s. Villareal and Bilbao were also involved in 2 of the most intriguing trade deals. </p> 
  
<br>
	   
	    <p><i>Inaki Williams from Bilbao going to Moncao in exchange for Ben Yedder, Walcott and 25mil. Considering Ben Yedder was advertised at 150mil this was quite some deal. Whilst Villareal brought in Zaha from Crsytal Palace in exchange for three of his 80 plus rated players
Moreno, Iborra and Gaspar.</i> </p>    	    
  
  <br>
	   
	    <p>Dazzler made quick work of Lukakus introduction to the league as a super star player, instantly getting in to trade the prolific striker for golf, Wales and occasional Real Madrid fan Gareth Bale. </p>
	    
	    <br>
	    
	    <p>Some of the best value deals were to be had in auctions. With so many auctions always a chance to snoop a cheap one with a cheeky low bid. </p> 
    
   <br> 
	   
	    <p><i>Vasco got 82 rated Delaney for a mere 1mil as did Arsenal resigning legend full back Kolasinic for 1mil.  Another great deal saw Getafe bringing in Eric Dier for a cheap 4mil.</i> </p>
	    	    
	    
	<br>
	   
	    <p>And its a sad end for Wayne Rooney who was released on a free by Boca, so could be his EUROPes career over before it even took off.  </p>
	    
	    <br>
	    <p>With around 350 transfers in total was a hectic period and expect to see a lot of new faces in the EUROpes as the league recommences.</p>
