	<h2>The three biggest transfers:</h2>
    
  <ul><li>Keita to Boca Jnrs for 90m in auction</li>
<li>Fekir Betis to Inter Milan 80m</li>
<li>Musa to Vasco da Gama 76mil in auction</li>   </ul>

	<h2>The 3 biggest transfers between manager were:</h2>
    
  <ul><li>Fekir 80m from Betis to Inter Milan</li>
<li>Ibrahimovic 72m from Southampton to Betis</li>
<li>De Paul 70m from Udinese to Inter Milan</li>

  
  <p> The busiest clubs in the window were Flamengo, Villareal and Bilibao who all added more than 12 new players to their teamâ€™s. </p>
   
   <p>Villareal and Bilbao were also involved in 2 of the most intriguing trade deals. </p> 
  
<p><i>Inaki Williams from Bilbao going to Moncao in exchange for Ben Yedder, Walcott and 25mil. Considering Ben Yedder was advertised at 150mil this was quite some deal. <br>Another crazy deal saw Zaha going to Villareal in exchange for three of his 80 plus rated players
Moreno, Iborra and Gaspar.</i> </p> 
	    
	    <p>Worse was to follow for the Vasos as despite looking like heading into half time all square a comedy of errors occured as Pepe Reina must have caught the super contagious Liverpool Kariusvirus as he failed to collect the ball twice before it went through his legs leaving
 an easy tap in and a crazy turn around as Seville went from 3-1 down and out to leading at the break.</p> <br>
  
  <p>Dazzler made quick work of Lukakus introduction to the league as a super star player, instantly getting in to trade the prolific striker for golf, Wales and occasional Real Madrid fan Gareth Bale. </p>
	    
	    <p>Some of the best value deals were to be had in auctions. With so many auctions always a chance to snoop a cheap one with a cheeky low bid. </p> 
    
    <p><i>Vasco got 82 rated Delaney for a mere 1mil as did Arsenal resigning legend full back Kolasinic for 1mil.  Another great deal saw Getafe bringing in Eric Dier for a cheap 4mil.</i> </p>
	    
	    <p><i>Could he maintain his nerves and   get a cruel late winner? Will he chip? will he finesse? will he blast?
		    will keeper come out? will keeper come out then go back?... then come out then go back again?</i>
  all kind of thoughts running through his mind. </p>
	    
	    <p>And its a sad end for Wayne Rooney who was released on a free by Boca, so could be his EUROPes career over before it even took off.  </p>
	    
	    <p>With around 350 transfers in total was a hectic period and expect to see a lot of new faces in the EUROpes as the league recommences.</p>
