  <h>Vasco late for Victory- 29/4/20</h1>
  <p> The fire was up to full heat tonight in Rio as Vasco and Sevilla played out what was surely the Super league game of the season so far. Vasco were 
   dealt a massive blow before kick off as haaland was still absent due to coronavirus and 5g chip implantation vaccine surgery so Leao had to step
   up in only his 2nd start of the season. With Balotelli banging them in for Seville in recent games could Leao compete. A tale of two strikers.
   One in red hot form and the other in from the cold. 
   
   <p>Well it certainly was a night for attack as defenses were caught at sea. Leao dived right in with a quick goal to set the precedings. However, within minutes
    a fanatasitc 20yard strike
  from Ocampos silecned the home fans as it flew into top corner.  No problem for Vaso though this ship was steadied again as Leao preceded to bang in 2 more goals for a quick first half
  hat trick. The Samba was deafining, there was only one team here tonight Sevilla were sinking deep. </p>
  
<p>Though they would still give a fight and Balotelli was of course still to have his say in the match.  And he did. Some potent attacking from the away team and poor defense got them back in
  it to get 3-3. Looking like heading to half time all square a comedy of errors as Pepe Reina failed to collect the ball twice before it went through his legs leaving
 an easy tap in and a crazy turn around as Seville went from down and out to leading at the break.</p>
  
  <p>Could this game get any crazier? A Hamsik goal early into the second period levelled the tie once again. Another immediate reply as straight from kick off 
  a goal for Sevilla and Vasco having to chase game again. Leao the first half hat trick hero  became villain as he missed two easy chances.
  It looked as if the game was over.  With Vasos ship all but sunk heading to the 90th minute a patient attack and well played through pass sent Leao in to make ammends for recent
  miss and level the tie. A great escape but nothing less than the home team desereved and overall a thrilling end to the game. Or was it?
   </p> <p>
Deep into 3minute of added time and Vasco happy to take the draw a quick steal of the ball and they make a quick break. So much space, were Sevilla going for a late
  winner? It breaks to Greizmann who slips in fresh super sub Castillejo who runs free in on goal which will surely be last kick of the game.
  40 yard run to the goalkeeper seemed to take about 5mins and ElPesidentes hands were surely shaking by this point, could he maintain his nerves and 
  get a cruel late winner. Will he chip, will he finesse, will keeper come out, will keeper come out then go back, then come out then go back again
  all kind of thoughts running through his mind. But he had faith in his man Sami who made the decision for him with a well placed finesse into bottom corner.
  It was all over. 6-5 to Vasco. Seville fans all at sea And what a game, it had everything. Elpesidente is apparently in ER with heart attack and Shaka_Zulu suicide watch. We hope 
   to bring you good news about their fortunes soon.</p></div>
