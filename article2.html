<p>Starting from the top and it was a fierce battle to the end in d1 to see who would be champion with several teams battling it out until the last couple of weeks it was wide open. But in the end the most consistent player with the strong defence
as well as attack who managed to improve on his runners up spot last year and take the title, that of course was Wudinhita and Real Madrid.</p>

<p>At the other end Jorgecosta and Porto looked doomed for a while not even some changes in personal midseason was enough to save him. With one more team to join him Lille also looked doomed but a good 2nd half season got him out of the zone 
and at the last minute pharaoh and Roma slipped down and drops to d2 with Porto.</p>

<p>Moving on to d1, Kontra and Cagliari have been on fire all season along with Zenit and it was rarely in doubt these 2 would be promoted. Cagliari came out top to win the title and both go up. For the 3rd automatic spot Snakeater and his
dynamo moscow looked certainties but a late revival and string of wins from notts forest and Ljupco snatched him the 3rd automatic promotion spot in the end. Very good compensation for the fans after losing 2 finals.
</p>
<p>
So snakeater dropped to the playoffs and managed to get the finals against another strong opponent villareal and gingerbeardman, and luckily for snakeater the automatic spot loss was not so bad as he made promotion in the end via playoff.
Villareal and the rest must try again next season.</p>

<p>At the bottom, reeces Flamengo, betis and galatassary looked favourites for the drop at the mid way point but some problems for craiggers and the Lyon management didnt help their cause and in the end resulted in their relegation along with the Turks as they 2 go down to d3.
</p>
<p>
Whilst amazingly due to league restructure 6 teams go into d2 from d3. PSV and Celta vigo were the stand out teams and Vigo and goatinho take the title as well as promotion. PSV and diegoltu of course got runners up and promotion along with Getafe, Torino, Feynoord and Bournemouth.
</p>
<p>
Looking at the goals it was the main strikers you expect with Immobile and Icardi banging in almost 2 goals per game for Vegests Lazio and Taskiemans Arsenal. In d3 PSV loan signing Joelinton ended up top scorer and sealed himself a permanent
move to the club.
</p>
<p>
Moving on to the cups  it was more a story of the runner up than the winners this year. As Notts Forest managed to get to both finals but end up on losing side twice unfortunately for ljupco. However, great performances and efforts for Lazio and vegest to win
the World club cup which sees a smaller restructure format next season and Willbills Zenit with some amazing results to win the Grand Cup, another cup becoming extinct with the new format next season and reintroduction of the champions
league, lowropa cup and FA cup as the 3 main cup competitions.</p>

<p>
That about sums up the winners and losers from Season 2. With 8 new teams in season 3 and cup restructruring lots to look forward to.</p>
